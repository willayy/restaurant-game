A simulation of "The Restaurant" game

### Rules

Person B wants to have dinner every day with person A. Person A wants to avoid person B.

At the university there are two restaurants, a regular one (dining time 20 min),
and a fancy one (dining time 50 min). For simplicity, we assume that, at 12.00 each day,
A and B each choose a restaurant and go to lunch; they never choose not to eat, and they do not change their choice of restaurant that day.

What strategy should A use to choose a restaurant in order to minimize the time spent with B? What strategy should B use to maximize the
amount of time spent with A? If they both use the strategies you have chosen, how much time do they spend together per day on average?
